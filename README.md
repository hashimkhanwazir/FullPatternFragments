# (Origional Work) Star Pattern Fragments: Accessing Knowledge Graphs through Star Patterns
## (To be extended) Full pattern Fragments 
A github repository for Star Pattern Fragments server and client in Java (and client in Node.js). 
(To be extended) _We are planning to extend this work by implmenting Path and Sink shapped query patterns, and much more._ 

(original work) This Readme and repository are works in progress. The SPF version available here is the one used for experiments in our paper (see also our website at http://relweb.cs.aau.dk/spf/).

(original work) The server is available in the SPF.Server/ folder.

(original work) The client is available for both Java (SPF.Client/) and Node.js (Client.js/).

(To be extended) We will be working in Java SPF.Client 

Any questions, feel free to contact Christian Aebeloe at caebel@cs.aau.dk
